Hi, I'm Sujal Parajuli, a full-time student at Northern Kentucky University, where I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Information Technology with a focus on Cybersecurity and Network and System Administration. I'm an enthusiastic infosec learner, passionate about offensive and defensive security. Through this blog, I'll be sharing my experiences, challenges, and insights as I participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like HackTheBox, along with other cybersecurity adventures. Join me as I dive deeper into the world of cybersecurity!
